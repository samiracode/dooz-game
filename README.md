Dooz game is as same as "Four in Row" game but in Persian language is known as Dooz! There is aboard of 42 spaces and each player has 21 tokens. The player who can occupies 4 spaces in row, column or diagonal will be the winner.  

## What technologies are used?  
The Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and some animation effect from jQuery. That's it!

In future I would love to add a table of scores for every player and use the localStorage for collecting the scores.
